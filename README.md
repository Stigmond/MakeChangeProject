## Make Change Project

### Overview

This is a first-week assignment from the Skill Distillery Java Bootcamp.  This assignment asks for the creation of a program that takes in the purchase price of an item, the amount tendered, and the change returned in the form of optimal denominations (dollars, quarters, etc).  This program was assigned to allow students to test their knowledge of introductory concepts in Java.  

This version includes a menu with additional selections, which are not required by the core assignment.

### Topics

* Introduction to Eclipse
* Introduction to Git/GitHub
* Creating Scanner(s) / Taking User Input
* Variable Declaration, Initialization, and Re-assignment
* Loops (while and do-while)
* Switches
* Conditionals
* Methods (with Parameters and Return Values)
* Arithmetic statements (including modulo)
* Data Casting

### How to Run

1. Compile and/or run MakeChange.java in a compatible IDE or Java Runtime Environment of your choice.

2. Select from one of the three (3) options on the menu:

  * Option One calls the primary Make Change method.  While in this method, user will be prompted to input the purchase price of the object and the amount tendered by the purchaser.  Upon completion of the calculation of the change tendered, user will be given an option to repeat the method immediately by a selection of (y)es or (n)o.

  * Option Two calls a secondary method that displays a fictional company name and version.  Upon displaying this information, the program will reset to the main menu.

  * Option Three will exit the program.

3. Have Fun!
